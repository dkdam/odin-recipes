One of my first project that I have built from teaching myself how to build a website. At first I thought it was difficult but not as difficult as I thought. I did had to think abit as I was not used to it yet I enjoyed this.

This project is just a simple basic recipe website that is very simple. I've been learning the basics of HTML & CSS for a week and how they function and work. This is the work that I can apply so far as I'm still learning the basics.

I've begun taking on this course known as the Odin Project and it has been the most comprehensive course that seems to work best for me as it has great balance. What I mean by that is it's infomatively overloading yet the instructions are very simple & clear. It is difficult yet doable. It is challenging yet enjoyable.

Because this course doesn't hold your hand, it pretty much taught me how to think differently and solve my problems through. I basically had to learn to learn, learn to think, how to research properly and learn to basically ask the right questions. 

So far I really like what I do as I've been studying 3-5 hours daily and sometimes up to 9 hours whenever I can. I can see that this course isn't easy yet I like the challenge and solving problems which I will be looking foward to later down the road.
